v1.5.2  2014-02-09 11:43:55 EST  Mark Leighton Fisher

  - Fixed to require Perl 5.12.0 so Test::More can be used
    reliably. Given that 5.18.0 is out, I think this is a
    fair assumption. (Set::JaccardSimilarityCoefficient
    should work with earlier Perl's, but you will have some
    manual steps to get the tests working right.)
  - Modified dist.ini so versions are managed manually. I
    prefer to set my version numbers manually rather than
    managing them by software.
