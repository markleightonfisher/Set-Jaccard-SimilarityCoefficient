v1.6.1  2018-03-06 12:35:26 EST  Mark Leighton Fisher

  - Add t-kwalitee tests for Test::Kwalitee
    (00test-kwalitee.t) and Test::Kwalitee::Extra
    (01test-kwalitee-extra.t).
  - Update Changes file to include v1.6.0.

v1.6.0  2018-03-06 12:19:49 EST  Mark Leighton Fisher

  - Added prereqs Exception::Class, Set::Scalar, and
    Test::Most.
  - Fixed to use (and require) ReadonlyX instead of the
    increasingly hard-to-fix Readonly.
  - Fixed metadata for author email, copyright year, and
    and $VERSION.

v1.5.2  2014-02-09 11:43:55 EST  Mark Leighton Fisher

  - Fixed to require Perl 5.12.0 so Test::More can be used
    reliably. Given that 5.18.0 is out, I think this is a
    fair assumption. (Set::JaccardSimilarityCoefficient
    should work with earlier Perl's, but you will have some
    manual steps to get the tests working right.)
  - Modified dist.ini so versions are managed manually. I
    prefer to set my version numbers manually rather than
    managing them by software.
